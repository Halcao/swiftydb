There are many libraries out there with the goal to help developers easily create and use SQLite databases. 
Unfortunately developers still have to get bogged down in simple tasks like writing table deifinitions 
and SQL queries to interract with the database. SwiftyDB automatically handles everything you don't want to spend your time doing.

## Usage
Pure plug and play. All you have to do is create an instance of SwiftyDB, and everything will be handled automagically behind the scenes ðŸŽ©

```Swift
let database = SwiftyDB(name: "Test")
```
**Add or update a record**
```Swift
database.addObject(dog, update: true)
````

**Retrieve records matching some optional filters**
```Swift
/* Returns a singe Dog object from the database */
database.objectForType(Dog.self)
database.objectForType(Dog.self, withFilters: ["id": 1])

/* Returns an array of Dog objects from the database */
database.objectsForType(Dog.self)
database.objectsForType(Dog.self, withFilters: ["id": 1])
````

**Delete records matching some optional filters**
```Swift
database.deleteObjectsForType(Dog.self)
database.deleteObjectsForType(Dog.self, withFilters: ["name": "Max"])
```

### Defining your classes
Let's use this simple `Dog` class as an example

```Swift
class Dog {
    var id: Int?
    var name: String?
    var owner: String?
    var birth: NSDate?
}
```

All objects must conform to the `Storeable` protocol.

```Swift
public protocol Storable: Parsable {
    init()
}
```

#### Store and retrieve objects
In order to assign an objects properties dynamically, the class must be a subclass of `NSObject`, and all properties must be representable in in Objective-C. This unfortunate dependency will be removed when I find a better way of dynamically assigning properties.

If you for some reason want to avoid subclassing `NSObject`, scroll to the section ['Store pure Swift objects'](#storePureSwiftObjects)

```Swift
class Dog: NSObject, Storable {
    var id: NSNumber?
    var name: String?
    var owner: String?
    var birth: NSDate?
    
    override required init() {
        super.init()
    }
}
```

##### Primary keys
It is recommended you can implement the `PrimaryKeys` protocol. The `primaryKeys()` method should return a set of property names which uniquely identifies an object.

```Swift
extension Dog: PrimaryKeys {
    class func primaryKeys() -> Set<String> {
        return ["id"]
    }
}
```

##### Ignoring properties
If your class contains properties that you don't want in your database, you can implement the `IgnoredProperties` protocol.

```Swift
extension Dog: IgnoredProperties {
    class func ignoredProperties() -> Set<String> {
        return ["name"]
    }
}
```

If you of some reason cannot subclass NSObject, it is to my knowledge impossible to dynamically create objects and assign its properties. In that case, all you have to do is to make sure you object conforms to the `Storable` protocol. 

```Swift
class Dog: Storable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String?
    var owner: String?
    var birth: NSDate?
    
    init() {}
}
```

You can use the following methods to retrieve records as an array of dictionaries. 

```Swift
database.dataForType(Dog.self)
database.dataForType(Dog.self, withFilters: ["id": 1])
````
